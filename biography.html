            <strong>Biography</strong>
          </p>
          <p style="width:700px;" align="justify">
            John McCain is a Vietnam War veteran and a six-term U.S.
            senator from the state of Arizona. He was the Republican
            nominee for the 2008 presidential election, before his
            loss to Barack Obama.

          <p> <strong>Who Is John McCain?</strong> </p>
          <p style="width:700px;" align="justify">
            The son of a decorated Navy admiral, John McCain was born at
            the Coco Solo Naval Station in Panama on August 29, 1936.
            He enrolled at the U.S. Naval Academy and was dispatched to
            Vietnam, where he was tortured as a prisoner of war between
            1967 and 1973. After his release, McCain served as a Republican
            congressman and senator from the state of Arizona, earning renown
            as a "maverick" who challenged party orthodoxy. He launched a bid
            for the U.S. presidency in 1999 and earned the Republican nomination
            in 2008, before losing to Barack Obama. After winning a sixth
            Senate term in 2016, McCain made headlines for his opposition
            to Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare and his battle with
            brain cancer.
