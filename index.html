    <h2>Phoenix</h2>
    <p style="width:700px;" align="justify">No creature symbolizes eternal life more than the phoenix,
       a mythical bird known as much for its beauty as its immortality.
       The legend of the phoenix appears in a variety of ancient mythologies,
       including Greek, Egyptian and Indian.It is usually depicted as an eagle
       or other bird of prey, but may also resemble a heron in its delicate majesty.
       In most mythologies, the phoenix is associated with the rising of the sun
       and has a close relationship with the sun-god Ra. Another feature of the
       phoenix is that only one can exist at a time. When it senses that its life
       is coming to an end - about once every thousand years - the phoenix builds
       itself a funeral pyre made of cinnamon or other aromatic material and allows
       itself to be consumed by the flames. Then, as the old phoenix is reduced to
       ashes, a new one rises to begin its life on Earth.
